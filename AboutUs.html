    <p class="centertxt"> Professional House for Legal Translation was established in 2020, which is considered as a surviving company that was established just before the start of COVID 19 pandemic. This company has promised itself to provide the best quality of professional translated documents for and for companies.
       It's translation of language that's used in legal settings and for legal purposes. Legal translation may also imply that it is a specific type of translation only used in law, which is not always the case.
       We grew with our base of clients, their trust is our team's feul. We wish you soon become one of them. Welcome in the family!
